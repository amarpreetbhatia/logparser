# Initial Migration Prompt

This prompt was used to initiate the migration of the Java application to a JavaScript-based AWS Lambda project.

```
You need to modernize a Java application hosted in GitHub "https://github.com/amarpreetbhatia/logparser" and convert to JavaScript based project and design and build application ready to deploy on AWS Lambda after migration. Create a new branch in this repository and name 'migration/awslambda' and want to test this new application locally to develop accordingly.
```

## Key Requirements

1. Convert Java application to JavaScript
2. Design for AWS Lambda deployment
3. Create a new branch called 'migration/awslambda'
4. Ensure local testing capability

## Migration Approach

The migration followed these steps:

1. Clone the original repository
2. Analyze the Java application structure and functionality
3. Create a new branch for the migration work
4. Set up a Node.js project structure
5. Convert Java models to JavaScript classes
6. Implement core services for log parsing and analysis
7. Add utility functions for date handling and data processing
8. Configure AWS Lambda deployment with serverless.yml
9. Set up local development environment
10. Add unit tests for core functionality
11. Update documentation
